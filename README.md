# ðŸš€ About Amazon Mockup Website

I was given a task @AppleSeeds Bootcamp to to build a responsive product page from Amazon website.<br>
The product page was copied using `HTML`,`CSS`,`Transition`,`Flex` and a little bit `JavaScript`.

### Navbar

Creating two Navbars for desktop and mobile.

### Product Section

I built the product section using Flex and also made a different design for desktop and mobile.

### Gallery Section

The image gallery is static and was built using Flex, on mobile there is no gallery view at all, only images.
